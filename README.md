# REST-API
A Node.js REST API application with five different routes.  - no UI (yet): see [Rest-Api UI](https://github.com/luminietos/REST-API-UI) for that specific addition.

## Description
This is a REST API application created in April 2023. 

It was made using and utilizing JavaScript, JSON, Node.js, [Express](https://expressjs.com/), and a bit of EJS, HTML and CSS. The movie database used in this project is from [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) (sample_mflix).

You can find this project's site by clicking [here](https://github.com/luminietos/REST-API) (GitHub) or [here](https://restapi-luminietos.onrender.com/) (Render).

## Step-by-step guide - *"How do I actually use this site?"*
The link for the site without its UI can be found above. Go to this project's [second part](https://github.com/luminietos/REST-API-UI) to see the version of this site with an actual UI. 

Q: "Why did you deploy this project, too, if there's no UI among this code?"
A: It's part of the assignment grading, to get more practice in deployment. These were marked as separate assignments, so the repos are also separate to save everyone involved the headache. 
 
## Purpose
This is the second of the three projects (first being [a Node.js Guestbook](https://github.com/luminietos/GB)) I created for my University's Full Stack course. 

Technically, the third project is a continuation of this project, as I simply create a UI for the code I have here. However, for clarity, the 'third project' (or project 2.2, really) is [in its own, separate repository](). Much of the same code will be used for obvious reasons.  

## Status
The development of this project is ongoing.
